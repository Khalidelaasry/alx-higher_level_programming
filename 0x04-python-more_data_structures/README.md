# 0x04. Python - More Data Structures

## Overview

The "0x04-python-more_data_structures" project extends the understanding of data structures in Python, focusing on more advanced concepts and operations. The project includes a variety of Python scripts, each addressing different aspects of data structures such as dictionaries, sets, and advanced list operations.
